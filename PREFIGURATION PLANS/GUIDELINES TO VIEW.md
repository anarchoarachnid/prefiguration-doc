The titles for folders in the PREFIGURATION PLANS folder has an order. It is a number system of projects that I am currently working on. This order is subject to change.

The way you name a file is you put a number, the one which you think best suits the proximity that you will be working on in said project, and then the name. Simple!

1: Currently working on it.

2: Could work on it in the future, but is not a priority right now, or is not possible right now.

3: Future projects that I am interested in, but that I cannot work on right now, as I do not have the resources or the time.
