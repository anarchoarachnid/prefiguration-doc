The titles for folders in the PREFIGURATION PLANS folder has an order, first you state whether its a Project, Area, Resource, or Archive, as said by the [PARA system (https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) organizational method, then you put the name of the doc! Simple. 

The system of PARA goes from Project (Narrow focus, more immediate action) to Resource (Broadest focus, just broadly interested in), and the last A is Archive, which we will cover later.

Project: Narrow focus, more immediate action, actively working on it.

Area: Larger focus, things for the long term.

Resource: Broadest focus, broadly interested in it, not working on it currently.

Archive: Uninterested, not focused on it, or a cancelled project.
